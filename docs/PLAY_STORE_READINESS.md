- Generic Expo configuration

### ✅ Required Changes

**1.1 Update app.json** ✅ COMPLETED
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Pensieve",
    "slug": "pensieve",
    "version": "1.0.1",
    "android": {
      "package": "com.pensieve.app"
    }
  }
}
```

- Create adaptive icon for Android

**1.3 Update AndroidManifest.xml**

## 🔒 CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Privacy & Legal Compliance

### ❌ Current Problems
- No Privacy Policy
- No Terms of Service
- Missing data collection disclosures
- Overly broad storage permissions

### ✅ Required Documents

**2.1 Privacy Policy Requirements** ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Must include:
  - Data collection practices
  - How journal entries are stored
  - User data rights (access, deletion, export)

```

Now using minimal permissions:
- Internet (for news feeds)
