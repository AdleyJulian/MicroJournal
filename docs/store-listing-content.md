```
Pensieve combines journaling with the science of spaced repetition to help build your autobiographical memory. 

üß† **Memory Enhancement Through Spaced Repetition**
Our smart system turns your daily entries into flashcards that appear right before you forget them. This scientifically-proven method helps build superior autobiographical memory over time.

üìù **Quick Daily Entries**
Record 3-5 simple entries a day. Each entry becomes a memory anchor that helps you recall your day distinctly. Add photos, organize with tags, and capture thoughts inspired by current events.

üìÖ **Smart Flashcard Reviews**
Your entries automatically become flashcards. Our spaced repetition system shows them to you at the perfect time - right before you forget. Rate how well you remember each one, and the system learns to optimize your review schedule.

üîÑ **Superior Autobiographical Memory**
Over time, you'll develop the ability to remember each day distinctly. Explore your memory timeline with timeline views. Give each day a unique identity you can look back on.

üåü **Daily Habit Building**
Build consistent journaling habits with daily streaks and progress tracking. Watch as small, regular reflections compound into a comprehensive personal knowledge base over time.


**Why Pensieve?**
Unlike traditional note-taking apps that just organize information, Pensieve focuses on retention. Our spaced repetition system ensures that important information stays accessible in your memory, not just in your digital storage.

**Privacy First**
All your data stays on your device. No accounts, no cloud storage, no tracking. Your thoughts remain completely private and secure.

**Start your memory enhancement journey today!**
