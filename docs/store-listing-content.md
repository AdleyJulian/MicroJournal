Pensieve is your personal memory enhancement tool that combines the art of journaling with the science of spaced repetition. Never forget important insights, lessons learned, or meaningful moments again.

🧠 **Smart Memory Enhancement**
Our advanced FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm intelligently determines when you should review each entry to maximize long-term retention. Unlike simple reminder apps, Pensieve learns from your memory patterns and adapts review schedules accordingly.

📝 **Rich Journaling Experience**
Create journal entries with text, images, and media. Use our news feed integration to capture thoughts inspired by current events, or create standalone entries for personal reflection. Organize your entries with custom tags and categories.

📅 **Timeline & Calendar Views**
Explore your memory timeline with beautiful calendar and timeline views. See patterns in your thinking, track personal growth, and rediscover forgotten insights from months or years ago.

🔄 **Seamless Data Management**
Full export/import functionality ensures your data is always under your control. Backup to JSON/CSV, migrate between devices, or integrate with other tools. Your journal entries stay private and secure on your device.

🌟 **Daily Habit Building**
Build consistent journaling habits with daily streaks and progress tracking. Watch as small, regular reflections compound into a comprehensive personal knowledge base over time.

🎯 **Perfect For**
• Students reviewing lecture notes and concepts
• Professionals tracking project insights and decisions

• Anyone wanting to preserve meaningful life experiences
• Researchers maintaining detailed observation logs

**Why Pensieve?**
While traditional note-taking apps focus on organization, Pensieve focuses on retention. Our scientifically-proven spaced repetition system ensures that important information stays accessible in your memory, not just in your digital storage.
