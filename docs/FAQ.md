## üß† About Spaced Repetition & FSRS

### What is spaced repetition?
Spaced repetition is a learning technique that shows information at increasing intervals to help you remember it longer. Instead of cramming, you review material just before you would naturally forget it.

### What is FSRS?
**Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS)** is an advanced algorithm that learns from your personal memory patterns. Unlike traditional methods with fixed schedules, FSRS adapts to how you specifically remember information for better retention.

### Why use FSRS over other methods?
- **Personalized**: Learns your unique memory patterns
- **Efficient**: Up to 30% less review time
- **Smart**: Predicts when you'll forget and schedules reviews accordingly
- **Research-backed**: Based on scientific memory research

## üìù Getting Started

### How do I create my first memory?
1. Tap the **Create** tab
2. Answer the daily questions about your day
3. Add a photo if you like
4. Save your entry

### What should I write about?
Focus on specific, memorable moments:
- What did you do today that was interesting?
- Who did you talk to and what was memorable?
- What did you learn or discover?
- How did you feel about significant moments?

### How many entries should I create daily?
Start with 3-5 entries per day. Quality matters more than quantity - one meaningful memory is better than many forgettable ones.

## üîÑ Review System

### When do I get notified to review?
The app uses FSRS to schedule reviews at optimal intervals. You'll get notifications when entries are due for review, typically starting 1-2 days after creation and extending to weeks or months.

### What do the rating buttons mean?
- **Again**: I completely forgot this
- **Hard**: I remembered but with difficulty
- **Good**: I remembered clearly
- **Easy**: I remembered effortlessly

### Can I review entries before they're due?
Yes! Use the "Review Ahead" toggle to see future-due entries. This is great for staying ahead of your review schedule.

### What does "stability" mean?
Stability measures how well you've retained a memory. Higher stability means you can go longer between reviews.
